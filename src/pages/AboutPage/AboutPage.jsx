            <p>Today, we all have so much to do and so little time to do them all.  
                Trying to remember all that needs to be done, can get a bit confusing at the end of the day.  
                Simple solution, like mytodos app, can come to your rescue.  Mytodos app is just that, an app to organize all your todos and add notes too! 

            </p>
